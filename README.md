# Clock Task (HTML and CSS only)

The goal is to create analogue clock and make it work.
You are allowed to use only CSS and HTML to solve this task.
Usually just writing some additional css in app.css file should do.

### Hint 1:
Add styles to display clock hours, seconds and minutes handles.
They are called: "hours", "minutes" and "seconds" in the index.html file.

### Hint 2:
Once you have clock handles displayed, lets make them move!
You will need some css transition and animations for that.

### Hint 3:
To make seconds, minutes and hours handles move just like the clock handles in real life do,
try to add some maths!
